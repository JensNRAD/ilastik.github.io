#Navigation 

##Viewer layout 
Most applets include a data viewer component in the lower right corner
of ilastik's main window, like the one shown below:

<a href="screenshots/volumina-view.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="screenshots/volumina-view.png" class="img-responsive" /></a>

The data is shown using three orthogonal slicing planes. The
x-view (red) shows y,z-slices, the
y-view (green) shows x,z slices and the
z-view (blue) shows x,y-slices.

The red, green and blue lines indicate the current position
(given by the slicing position of the three planes). These lines
can be hidden with the _Position_ checkbox in the lower right.

In the lower left, the current coordinate _under the mouse_
are shown.

##Navigation Overlay
In each of the three slice views, there is an overlay dedicated
to navigation at the top. The
_x_-view has a red color, 
_y_-view has a green color and the
_z_-view has a blue color.

<a href="screenshots/hud.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="screenshots/hud.png" class="img-responsive" /></a>

* ![](screenshots/hud_00.png)
  Navigate to a particular slice number.
  Click into the spin box and type in a new slice
  position.
  
* ![](screenshots/hud_01.png)
  The arrows rotate this view by 90 degrees left or right.
  The button in the middle swaps the two axes.
  
* ![](screenshots/hud_02.png)
  Indicates the current zoom percentage.

* ![](screenshots/hud_03.png)
  Zoom to fit (show the entire slice) and reset the zoom level to
  100%.
  
* ![](screenshots/hud_04.png)
  Dock the slice view out of the application window. The view
  becomes its own window, which can be moved to a second monitor for example.
  To dock the view back into ilastik's main window, click the arrow again.
  
* ![](screenshots/hud_05.png)
  Maximize the slice view. The other two slice views will be hidden.
  Clicking this button again restores the original layout.
  
##Mouse & Keyboard

* Use the _Mouse wheel_ to scroll forward/backward through the stack
  represented by the slice view
* Hold _Ctrl_ ( _Cmd_ on Mac OS X) while using the mouse wheel to zoom in/out (if the cursor is over one 2D slicing plane,
  the respective plane is zoomed, otherwise all 3 slicing planes are zoomed simultaneously)
* Hold _Shift_ while using the mouse wheel to browse a time sequence
* Pan the view by holding moving the mouse with the _middle mouse button_
  pressed
* jump to a new 3D position by _double clicking_

##3D view

<a href="screenshots/hud3d.png" data-toggle="lightbox"><img src="screenshots/hud3d.png" class="img-responsive" /></a>

* ![](screenshots/hud3d_00.png) toggle the visibility of 
  x, y or z slicing planes. Often, because the planes are draggable,
  they hinder the interaction with the data or make it difficult to rotate
  the view.

* ![](screenshots/hud3d_01.png) 
  Toggle anaglyph (needs red/blue glasses) rendering.

* ![](screenshots/hud3d_02.png) 
  Dock the 3D view out of ilastik's main window (for example to move it to
  another screen). Another click docks the window back.
